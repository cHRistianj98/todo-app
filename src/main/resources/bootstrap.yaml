#  The bootstrap.yml file in a Spring Boot project is used to configure the application before loading the main
#  configuration file, application.yml or application.properties.
#
#  The main purpose of bootstrap.yml is to configure the runtime context for the application.
#  This means that the file is used to configure aspects of the application that have an impact on
#  the process of running the application, such as:
#
#  Configuration of the configuration server (e.g., URL, username, password)
#  Configuration of application profiling
#  Configuration of REST clients or other external services that the application uses
#  bootstrap.yml is loaded before application.yml or application.properties, so the configuration in it
#  is available to the entire application. In the case of conflicts between the configuration in bootstrap.yml
#  and application.yml, the former takes priority.
#
# It's worth noting that bootstrap.yml is not required, and many applications don't use it at all.
# However, if an application requires configuring the runtime context, it's worth considering using this file.
